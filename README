This is a new readme file. 
I plan on writing some sproutcore tutorials to extend the existing tutorials.

They will go here.

This is a fork of step 5 of the todos application.
The idea behind this fork is to focus on some GUI components usage, datasource \
usage, and other advanced usages.

The idea is that we augment the tutorial and add to it.

As we learn to do new things, we add them to the tutorial.

My hope is that these ideas can be added upon and shared.

My hope is to grow the sproutcore community and learn more about sproutcore in \
the process.

I am new to git, here is my cheatsheet.

To commit local changes I do this:

 git commit  -a -m "THIRD COMMIT"

To push changes to the remote repo on github I do this:

 git push origin master


To setup a new remote repo, I do this:

 git remote add origin git@github.com:RichardHightower/todo-sproutcore-tut.git

To pull down (svn up) from the repo, I do this:

 git pull origin master

You can just type:

 git push

To add things to the repo after the origin has been defined.
